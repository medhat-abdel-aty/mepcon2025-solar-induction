## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This repository accompanies the MEPCON 2025 paper:  
**"Solar-Ready Induction Heating in the Egyptian Desert: Logic- vs Arduino-Controlled Dual-Mode PWM Three-Phase Inverter."**

It provides the Arduino firmware used in the reported experiments (Appendix A) and a suggested timer-based enhancement (Appendix B) for academic reproducibility and educational use.

## ðŸ”¹ Contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `appendix_a_software_pwm.ino` | **Experimental firmware actually used** in the 5 kHz tests. Implements software-based complementary three-phase PWM using `delayMicroseconds()` with programmable dead-time and safety checks. |
| `appendix_b_timer_pwm.ino` | **Suggested enhancement** using hardware Timer1 for a 20 kHz PWM. Provided for demonstration of higher-frequency, hardware-timed control (not used in reported measurements). |
| `eagle_logic_controller.sch / .brd` | **EAGLE schematic and PCB layout** of the logic-based PWM controller corresponding to Fig. 2 in the paper. Provided for controlled academic review. |
| `README.md` | This documentation file. |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Experimental Notes
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega328P (Arduino UNO)  
- **PWM Frequencies:** 5 kHz (software) and 20 kHz (hardware timer example)  
- **Dead-time:** 1â€“3 Âµs (programmable)  
- **Supply:** 12 V / 90 Ah deep-cycle battery  
- **Load:** 1.5 kW, 4-pole, three-phase induction motor  

The setup enables comparison between logic-based and Arduino-based PWM control for off-grid, solar-ready induction heating applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Hardware Schematics Notice
For confidentiality and intellectual-property protection,  
only **simplified block diagrams** are presented in the MEPCON 2025 paper (Fig. 1â€“2).  
The **complete EAGLE schematic and PCB layout** used to generate the hardware logic controller (corresponding to Fig. 2) have been **archived privately** within this repository and may be shared **upon reasonable academic request** to the author or MEPCON 2025 committee reviewers.  
Detailed COMSOL simulation files remain restricted under research license agreements.
